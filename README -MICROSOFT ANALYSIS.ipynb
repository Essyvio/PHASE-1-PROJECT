    "Microsoft have decided to create a new movie studio and require more insight into which types of films are doing best at the box office.This repo helps to explore relationships between average rating, numof votes and the domestic gross.The study uses descriptive analysis for the study with the data gathered originating from several libraries that is Csv,Numpy,pandas,seaborn, matplot among several libraries.The analysis has used three data sets for analysis; this include imdb.title basics;imdb.title ratings& bom.movie gross to give an insight on which genre combination Microsoft should employ to maximize their profits through high domestic gross sales.The data has missing values on three parameters;genre,runtime & domestic_gross with a 1%,10% &95% of the percentage of missing data.Since runtime_minutes & genres had small percentage of the data  missing, dropping those rows or columns might not significantly impact my analysis.For the domestic gross;the number of missing values is 95% thus dropping the missing values could affect my analysis hence imputation will be the best technique to use in retaining more data & also reducing the impact of dropping of missing values.For successful, sustained gross earnings over time, Microsoft  should produce History genres. The genre has the highest  amount of gross earnings of 369Million dollars per film.The data performed a feature engineering by rating the audience preferences in terms of 'Poor', 'Fair', 'Average', 'Good'& 'Excellent & restriction on the genre to be watched based on the age groups into the three categories; 'rated PG', 'restricted', 'no restriction.During handling outliers a box plot was used.The data has used groupby to conduct exploratory data analysis.In addition to this visualization has used Four method which include; barplot, scatter diagram, heatmap & histogram .\n",
